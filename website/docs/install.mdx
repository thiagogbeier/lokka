# Install Lokka

To get started with Lokka you need to

1. Create an Entra app and 
1. Configure it with your AI agent (VS Code GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop or any other compatible MCP client).

## Pre-requisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - If you already have Node 16 or higher installed you can skip this step.
  - Check by running `node -v` at the command prompt.

## 1️⃣ → Create an Entra app for Lokka

- Open [Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) > **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**
  - Tip: [enappreg.cmd.ms](https://enappreg.cmd.ms) is a shortcut to the App registrations page.
- Select **New registration**
- Enter a name for the application (e.g. `Lokka`)
- Select **Register**
- Select **API permissions** > **Add a permission**
- Select **Microsoft Graph** > **Application permissions**
- Search for each of the permissions and check the box next to each permission you want to allow.
  - The agent will only be able to perform the actions based on the permissions you grant it.
- Select **Add permissions**
- Select **Grant admin consent for [your organization]**
- Select **Yes** to confirm

#### Create a client secret

- Select **Certificates & secrets** > **Client secrets** > **New client secret**
- Enter a description for the secret (e.g. `Agent Config`)
- Select **Add**
- Copy the value of the secret, we will use this value in the agent configuration file.

## 2️⃣ → Configure the agent

Now you can use the Lokka agent tool with any compatible MCP client and LLM combo.

Claude is the simplest way to get started and provides the best experience. You can use the free version of Claude Desktop to test Lokka (there are daily limits on the free version).

GitHub Copilot Agent in VS Code is a great option if you already have GitHub Copilot Pro subscription. It comes with Claude 3.7 Sonnet support.

### Add Lokka to Claude Desktop

- In the **Developer** tab, click **Edit Config**
  - Note: If you don't see the Developer tab, you need to enable it first from `Help` > `Enable Developer Mode`.
- This opens explorer, edit `claude_desktop_config.json` in your favorite text editor.
- Add the following configuration to the file, using the information you in the **Overview** blade of the Entra application you created earlier.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Lokka-Microsoft-Graph": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@merill/lokka"],
      "env": {
        "TENANT_ID": "<tenant-id>",
        "CLIENT_ID": "<client-id>",
        "CLIENT_SECRET": "<client-secret>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Exit Claude Desktop and restart it.
  - Every time you make changes to the code or configuration, you need to restart Claude desktop for the changes to take effect.
  - Note: In Windows, Claude doesn't exit when you close the window, it runs in the background. You can find it in the system tray. Right-click on the icon and select **Quit** to exit the application completely.

### Testing the agent

- Open the Claude Desktop application.
- In the chat window on the bottom right you should see a hammer icon if the configuration is correct.
- Now you can start quering your Microsoft tenant using the Lokka agent tool.
- Some sample queries you can try are:
  - `Get all users in my tenant`
  - `Show me the details for John Doe`
  - `Change John's department to IT` - Needs User.ReadWrite.All permission to be granted
